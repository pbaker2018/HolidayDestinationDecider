# Holiday Destination Decider Android App

This is a simple one-page Android App that takes an array of holiday destinations and will randomly select one for you when you click on the 'where to go' button. It has the additional function of allowing the user to 'add' more destinations to the array. 

The App uses Kotlin and this is my second time using Kotlin. It was built using Android Studio.
